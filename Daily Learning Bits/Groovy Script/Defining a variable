what is def in groovy script


In Groovy, `def` is a keyword used to define a variable with no specific type. It's an example of Groovy's dynamic typing capability, allowing a variable to hold any type of object. When you declare a variable with `def`, Groovy determines the actual type at runtime based on the assigned value.

Here's an example:

```groovy
def message = "Hello, World!"
println(message)
```

In this case, `message` is inferred to be a `String` because it's assigned a string literal. However, if later in the script you assign a different type of object to `message`, Groovy will accept that too, because `def` essentially means "the type will be determined at runtime."

You can also use `def` for method return types, which allows the method to return different types of objects:

```groovy
def add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

The `add` method can return an `Integer`, `Double`, `String`, etc., depending on the types of the arguments passed to it. This flexibility is one of the features that makes Groovy a dynamic language.

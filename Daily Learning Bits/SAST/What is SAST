what is sast?


SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, is a method of testing that analyzes source code, byte code, or binaries for security vulnerabilities. It's performed without executing the code, often referred to as "white box" testing. Here's what SAST involves:

- **Early Detection**: It identifies vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), allowing for prompt remediation.
- **Automated Scanning**: SAST tools automatically scan the codebase to find security issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
- **Developer Feedback**: These tools provide real-time feedback to developers, highlighting problematic code and offering guidance on fixes.
- **Continuous Integration**: SAST can be integrated into daily builds or version control check-ins, ensuring continuous security oversight.

SAST is crucial for creating secure applications by catching flaws before they become security risks in production¹²³⁴⁵.

Can you explain how a typical SAST scan works?


Certainly! A typical Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scan is a process that analyzes source code to identify security vulnerabilities. Here's how it generally works:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: The SAST tool scans the application's source code and bytecode, looking for patterns that match known security flaws¹².
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: It focuses on detecting issues like injection attacks, buffer overflows, and memory management problems before the code is compiled¹².
3. **White Box Testing**: This type of testing is also known as white box testing because it's done with an understanding of the internal structure of the application².
4. **Real-Time Feedback**: Developers receive real-time feedback from SAST tools as they code, helping them fix issues immediately¹.
5. **Graphical Representations**: The tools provide graphical representations of the issues found, making it easier to navigate the code and understand the vulnerabilities¹.
6. **Issue Resolution**: SAST tools often point out the exact location of vulnerabilities and provide guidance on how to fix them¹.
7. **Regular Scans**: To ensure code security, SAST tools must be run regularly, such as during daily builds or code check-ins¹.

By integrating SAST into the software development life cycle (SDLC), developers can identify and resolve security issues early, contributing to the creation of a secure SDLC¹.

Can you explain how I can set up a basic SAST scan for my project?


Setting up a basic Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scan for your project involves several steps. Here's a simplified guide to get you started:

1. **Choose a SAST Tool**: Select a SAST tool that supports the programming languages and frameworks you're using. Many tools offer integrations with popular CI/CD platforms.

2. **Integrate with Your CI/CD Pipeline**: Configure the SAST tool to run as part of your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. This typically involves adding a new job or step in your CI configuration file that invokes the SAST tool.

3. **Configure the SAST Tool**: Customize the settings of your SAST tool to match your project's requirements. This may include setting up rules, exclusions, and severity levels for identified issues.

4. **Run the SAST Scan**: Execute the SAST scan by triggering the CI pipeline. The SAST tool will analyze your codebase and identify potential security vulnerabilities.

5. **Review the Results**: Once the scan is complete, review the results to identify and prioritize issues for remediation. Some tools provide dashboards and detailed reports to help with this process.

6. **Fix Vulnerabilities**: Address the identified security issues by making the necessary code changes. It's important to remediate vulnerabilities as early as possible to reduce security risks.

7. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously improve your SAST setup by refining the configuration, updating rules, and regularly reviewing scan results to keep up with evolving security threats.

For specific instructions, you can refer to the documentation of the SAST tool you've chosen. For example, if you're using GitLab, they provide a comprehensive guide on setting up SAST¹. Similarly, Checkmarx offers detailed steps for creating and configuring a SAST project². It's also helpful to consult resources like Spectral's Dev tutorial for running a SAST test³.

Remember, the exact steps may vary depending on the tool and the CI/CD platform you are using. It's crucial to refer to the official documentation for precise instructions tailored to your setup.

What are some limitations of SAST scans?


Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a powerful tool for detecting potential security vulnerabilities in code, but it does have some limitations:

1. **False Positives/Negatives**: SAST can produce false positives, flagging code as vulnerable when it's not, and false negatives, missing real vulnerabilities¹⁴⁶.
2. **Limited Runtime Analysis**: SAST may not effectively identify runtime vulnerabilities or configuration-related issues, as it analyzes static code³.
3. **Source Code Access**: SAST requires access to the application's source code, which may not always be available or feasible³.
4. **Complexity in Remediation**: While SAST can identify issues, understanding and fixing them can be complex, especially for those without a security background².
5. **Scope of Detection**: SAST focuses on implementation flaws and might not detect logical errors or issues outside the code, like server configuration errors⁴.
6. **Manual Review**: Some manual review is often required to filter out false positives and verify the findings, which can be resource-intensive⁴⁶.

These limitations highlight the importance of complementing SAST with other types of security testing, such as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), to ensure a more comprehensive approach to application security⁴.

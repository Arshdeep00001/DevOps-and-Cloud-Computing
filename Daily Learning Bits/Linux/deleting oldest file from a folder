how to delete the oldest file from a folder in linux if the count of the files is more than 5


There are different ways to delete the oldest file from a folder in Linux if the count of the files is more than 5. Here are some possible solutions:

- You can use `find` to find the files that are older than a certain number of days, and then use `-delete` or `-exec rm` to remove them. For example, this command will delete the files that are older than 10 days in the folder `/media/downloads`:

```bash
find /media/downloads -type f -mtime +10 -delete
```

- You can use a loop to iterate over the files in the folder, and use `stat` or `date` to get the modification time of each file. Then you can compare the times and store the oldest file name in a variable. After the loop, you can delete the file stored in the variable. For example, this script will delete the oldest file in the current folder:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
oldest_file=""
oldest_time=0
for file in *; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    file_time=$(stat -c %Y "$file")
    if [ $file_time -gt $oldest_time ]; then
      oldest_file="$file"
      oldest_time=$file_time
    fi
  fi
done
if [ -n "$oldest_file" ]; then
  rm "$oldest_file"
fi
```

how to check who is the root user for a server


To check who has root access on a server, you can use the `id` command with the username to see their user ID (UID). The root user always has a UID of 0. Here's the command:

```bash
id username
```

Replace `username` with the actual username you want to check. If the output shows `uid=0(root)`, then that user has root access.

Additionally, you can check the `/etc/passwd` file for the root user's entry, which should also show a UID of 0:

```bash
grep "^root:" /etc/passwd
```

This will display the root user's details, confirming the UID as 0.

To see a list of users with sudo privileges, which effectively allows them to act as the root user, you can inspect the `/etc/sudoers` file or use the `sudo -l` command while logged in as the respective user:

```bash
sudo -l
```

This command will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user on the host. If the user can run commands as root, they have root-level access. Remember, you may need appropriate permissions to run these commands¹²³⁴.

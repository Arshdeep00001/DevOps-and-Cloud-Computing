tr  -d -c 0-9 command in linux


The `tr -d -c 0-9` command in Linux is used to delete all characters from the input except for digits (0-9). Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `tr`: The translate or delete utility.
- `-d`: Delete characters that are specified in the first set.
- `-c`: Complement the set of values provided. This means it will consider all characters that are **not** in the set.
- `0-9`: The range of characters to keep, which in this case is all digits.

So, when you run `tr -d -c 0-9`, it will remove all characters that are not digits from the standard input and write the result to the standard outputÂ³.

Here's an example of how it works:

```bash
echo 'Hello 123 World 456' | tr -d -c '0-9'
```

This command will output `123456`, stripping away all non-digit characters from the given string.

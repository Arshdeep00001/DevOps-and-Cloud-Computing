what is a build


In software development, a **build** refers to the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so¹. This process typically includes:
- **Version control**: Managing changes to the source code, ensuring repeatability and reliability of the build¹.
- **Code quality**: Ensuring the source code adheres to standards for maintainability, extensibility, and readability¹.
- **Compilation**: Transforming source code into executable or intermediate objects¹.
- **Linking**: Combining object files and libraries into a single executable file or another 'object' file¹.

Build tools like **Make**, **Gradle**, **Maven**, and others automate these processes to streamline the creation of the final software product¹. Builds can be **full** (building from scratch) or **incremental** (using the last build state and only rebuilding modified components)².

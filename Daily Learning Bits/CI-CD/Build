what is a build


In software development, a **build** refers to the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so¹. This process typically includes:
- **Version control**: Managing changes to the source code, ensuring repeatability and reliability of the build¹.
- **Code quality**: Ensuring the source code adheres to standards for maintainability, extensibility, and readability¹.
- **Compilation**: Transforming source code into executable or intermediate objects¹.
- **Linking**: Combining object files and libraries into a single executable file or another 'object' file¹.

Build tools like **Make**, **Gradle**, **Maven**, and others automate these processes to streamline the creation of the final software product¹. Builds can be **full** (building from scratch) or **incremental** (using the last build state and only rebuilding modified components)².

What is the difference between a build and a release?


The difference between a **build** and a **release** in software development is primarily about the stage of the software lifecycle they represent and their intended audience.

- **Build**:
  A build is a version of the software that is compiled from source code and is ready for testing or deployment. It's an internal milestone primarily used for testing and development purposes. Builds occur prior to release and are generated more frequently. They may have already undergone some testing or might be yet to be tested¹.

- **Release**:
  A release, on the other hand, is the distribution of the final version of an application to the end-users or customers. It comes after the build has been thoroughly tested and certified by the testing team. A release is based on one or more builds and signifies that the software no longer requires testing and is ready for production use¹.

In essence, a build is an iteration in the development process, while a release is the final product that is delivered to the customer after all testing and quality assurance processes have been completed.

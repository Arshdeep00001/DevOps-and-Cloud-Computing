what is ssh connectivity


SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote server, typically over an unsecured network. It allows you to log into another computer over a network, execute commands in a remote machine, and move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure channels. 

Here's a quick rundown of how SSH works:
- **SSH Client**: This is the software on your side that you use to start the connection.
- **SSH Server**: The software on the server's side that responds to the connection requests.
- **Encryption**: All data sent over an SSH session is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and connection hijacking.
- **Authentication**: Users authenticate themselves to the SSH server using passwords or cryptographic keys.
- **Commands Execution**: Once connected, you can execute commands on the server as if you were physically present.

To connect to a remote server via SSH, you would typically use the `ssh` command followed by the username and the host you want to connect to, like so:

```bash
ssh username@hostname
```

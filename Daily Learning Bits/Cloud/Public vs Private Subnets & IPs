Difference between public and private subnet?

The key difference between a public subnet and a private subnet lies in their ability to access and be accessed from the internet. Here’s a breakdown:

Public Subnet

Definition: A subnet that is directly accessible from the internet.

Route Table Configuration: It has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW), allowing resources in the subnet to send and receive traffic to/from the internet.

Use Cases:

Hosting public-facing services like web servers.

Resources that need to communicate directly with the internet.


Security Considerations: Resources in a public subnet are exposed to the internet, so proper security measures (e.g., firewalls, security groups) are critical.


Private Subnet

Definition: A subnet that is not directly accessible from the internet.

Route Table Configuration: It does not have a route to an Internet Gateway but can have routes to a NAT Gateway/Instance or other private network connections.

Use Cases:

Hosting backend services like databases, application servers, and other resources that should remain isolated.

Resources that only need to initiate outbound internet traffic (e.g., for software updates) but don't need inbound traffic from the internet.


Security Considerations: Resources in a private subnet are protected from direct internet exposure, adding an extra layer of security.


Key Differences:

By combining both types of subnets in a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), you can create a secure and scalable architecture where public and private resources interact seamlessly.

Difference between public and private ip?

The difference between a public IP and a private IP lies in their scope of use and accessibility. Here's a detailed explanation:


---

Public IP

Definition: A public IP address is globally unique and accessible over the internet.

Range: Allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and must be unique worldwide. Examples of public IP ranges include addresses not reserved for private use (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

Scope: Used to identify devices or servers on the internet.

Use Cases:

Hosting websites or services accessible from the internet.

Devices or systems that need direct communication with external networks.


Key Features:

Can be directly accessed from anywhere on the internet.

Requires proper security (e.g., firewalls) to prevent unauthorized access.




---

Private IP

Definition: A private IP address is used within private networks and is not accessible over the internet.

Range: Defined by the IANA for private use. These ranges are:

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)

172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)

192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)


Scope: Used for communication between devices within a local network (LAN).

Use Cases:

Assigning IP addresses to devices in a home, office, or cloud network.

Ensures that multiple devices can coexist on the same private network without conflict.


Key Features:

Not routable over the internet without NAT (Network Address Translation).

Adds a layer of security by isolating internal network traffic.

Key Differences:

By using public and private IPs together with NAT and firewalls, organizations can design secure, efficient, and scalable network architectures.

Terraform is used to automate the process of configuring Infrastructure for a Project. Eg, create ec2 instance, creating s3 buckets, creating a vpc network etc
There are other tools doing the same thing for the particular cloud platforms. So, why we use Terraform is because it is cloud platforms independent and can be used for any cloud platform and On-Premise systems. 

Terraform commands 

Terraform init
Terraform plan
Terraform apply 
Terraform destroy 

Also, we have a Terraform state file that stores and records whatever has been created, updated or changed using the Terraform commands. This is also used for version controlling.

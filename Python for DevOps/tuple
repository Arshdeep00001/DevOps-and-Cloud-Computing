# A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. However, it is not possible to add, remove, or modify values in a tuple.
# A tuple is created by enclosing values within parentheses ( and ), separated by commas.
# Any data structure that cannot be modified after creation is called immutable. You can think of tuples as immutable lists.

my_color = ('red', 'blue', 'green')
#my_color[1] = 'black'   # Error:- 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
print (len(my_color))
print (my_color[0])
print('yellow' in my_color)
print(type(my_color))

# You can also skip the parantheses ( and ) while creating a tuple. Python automatically converts comma-separated values into a tuple.
my_shape = 'square', 'circle', 'rectangle'
#my_shape[1] = 'triangle'    # Error:- 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
#my_shape.append('triangle')     # Error:- 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
#my_shape.remove('triangle')     # Error:- 'tuple' object has no attribute 'remove'
print (my_shape[0])
# You can also create a tuple with just one element by typing a comma after it.
my_name = 'Arsh',
print(type(my_name))

# You can convert a list into a tuple using the tuple function, and vice versa using the list function
t = tuple(['a','b','c'])
print(type(t))
l = list(('d','e','f'))
print(type(l))
#help(my_color)     # There is an easier way to check a method's or object's documentation, use the 'help' function.
#Tuples have just two built-in methods: count and index.
